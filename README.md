# Final Project

## File Structure
- Commission: computes the commission earned by salesman of locks, stocks, and barrels
- NextDate: given month, date, and year, returns the date of the day after the input date
- Triangle: java program computing the type of triangle based on side lengths.

> These 3 problems and their pseudocode can be viewed in Module 2 Part II on Canvas or the book "Software Testing", starting with the [Triangle problem](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243925/pages/m2-partii-dot-2-unit-testing-illustration-1-the-triangle-problem?module_item_id=37158618)
### To Do (11/29 complete):

- [X] Create Triangle program
- [X] Create NextDate program
- [X] Create Commission program
- [X] Install JUnit for test case and data generation
- [X] Install JaCoCo plugin for test coverage graph and metrics
- [X] Generate test cases using JUnit: Triangle
- [X] Generate test cases using JUnit: Commission
- [X] Generate test cases using JUnit: NextDate
- [X] Compute the coverage with JaCoCo Triangle
- [X] Compute the coverage with JaCoCo Commission
- [X] Compute the coverage with JaCoCo NextDate
