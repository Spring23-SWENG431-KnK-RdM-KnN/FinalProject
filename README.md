# Final Project

## File Structure
- Commission: computes the commission earned by salesman of locks, stocks, and barrels
- NextDate: given month, date, and year, returns the date of the day after the input date
- Triangle: java program computing the type of triangle based on side lengths.

> These 3 problems and their pseudocode can be viewed in Module 2 Part II on Canvas or the book "Software Testing", starting with the [Triangle problem](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243925/pages/m2-partii-dot-2-unit-testing-illustration-1-the-triangle-problem?module_item_id=37158618)
