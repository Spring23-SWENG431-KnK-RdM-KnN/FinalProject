# Final Project

## File Structure
- Commision: computes the commision earned by salesman of locks, stocks, and barrels
- NextDate: given month, date, and year, returns the date of the day after the input date
- Triangle: java program computing the type of triangle based on side lengths.

> These 3 problems can be viewed with their pseudocode in Module 2 PartII on Canvas, starting with the [Triangle problem](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243925/pages/m2-partii-dot-2-unit-testing-illustration-1-the-triangle-problem?module_item_id=37158618)
### To Do (0/23 complete):

- [ ] Create Triangle program
- [ ] Create NextDate program
- [ ] Create Commision program
- [ ] Install JUnit for test case and data generation
- [ ] Install JaCoCo plugin for test coverage graph and metrics 
- [ ] Generate test cases using JUnit. Guide [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-test-data-instacio)
- [ ] Compute the coverage with JaCoCo
- [ ] Create tool to minimize test cases based on similarity metrics and optimization alogirithm
- [ ] Apply the created tool to generate new test data and test cases
- [ ] Execute programs and calculate coverage
- [ ] Use metrics to write report results
- [ ] Create graph and figures to display results
- [ ] Write Abstract 200-250 words
- [ ] Write Introduction 1.5 - 2 pgs
- [ ] Find 10-15 studies that are relevant to proposed method that software tool uses to minimize test cases
- [ ] Write 1.5 - 2 pgs about the relevant studies
- [ ] Write 2 - 5 pgs about the proposed method to improve testing. Includes tables and figures
- [ ] Write 1 - 2 pgs to explain the experiment in pseudocode, the datasets used, projects used, and what is being investigated with the experiment
- [ ] Write 2 - 5 pgs on results of experiment. Compare test cases and coverage before tool used and after
- [ ] Write 5 - 8 benefits the tool has for community
- [ ] Write 4 - 7 limitations of the experiment results
- [ ] Write conclusion paragraph/section
- [ ] List 15 - 20 relevant articles used in writing the report
