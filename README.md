# Final Project

## Instructions on How to Use OptimizationTool
1. Open OptimizationTool.java under the OptimizationTool directory and run it
2. Click the "Choose Project" button
3. Find and open your desired Project folder (Options include: Triangle, NextDate, Commission)
4. Select your desired values for the following values: "Test Cases/Suite", "Select Max Generation", "Select Minimum Coverage"
5. Click "Start Genetic Test Selection" button and then wait for output to appear
- ** Author's Note: The experimenters for this project have already utilized the "Gen JUnit4 Tests" button but due to the requirements of manual conversion, it is not advised to generate new tests when using the tool. **

## File Structure
- Commission: computes the commission earned by salesman of locks, stocks, and barrels
- NextDate: given month, date, and year, returns the date of the day after the input date
- Triangle: java program computing the type of triangle based on side lengths.

> These 3 problems and their pseudocode can be viewed in Module 2 Part II on Canvas or the book "Software Testing", starting with the [Triangle problem](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243925/pages/m2-partii-dot-2-unit-testing-illustration-1-the-triangle-problem?module_item_id=37158618)
